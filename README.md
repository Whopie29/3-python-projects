# Welcome to Multi Projects Repository

This repository contains three projects developed using Python. Each project serves a different purpose and demonstrates various aspects of programming and machine learning.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Chat Bot

The chat bot project simulates a basic conversational agent capable of responding to user queries related to programming languages. It uses regular expressions to identify keywords and provide predefined responses about specific programming languages.

### 2. Recommendation System

The recommendation system project implements a simple movie recommendation engine based on user preferences. It utilizes cosine similarity to recommend movies that match the user's specified genre preferences.

### 3. Tic Tac Toe Game

The Tic Tac Toe game project allows users to play the classic game against an AI opponent. The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm to make intelligent moves and provide a challenging gameplay experience.

## Installation and Requirements

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Chat Bot

To interact with the chat bot, run `chatbot.py` and follow the on-screen instructions to ask questions about programming languages.

### Recommendation System

Run `recommendation_system.py` to see movie recommendations based on predefined user preferences.

### Tic Tac Toe Game

Execute `tic_tac_toe.py` to play Tic Tac Toe against an AI opponent. Enter row and column numbers to make your moves and try to win against the AI.

## Additional Notes

- Each project is contained within its respective Python script file.
- Make sure to have an active internet connection for the chat bot to fetch information from Wikipedia.
- Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your requirements.
